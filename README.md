Cyber Threat Detection using ML

The Aegean WiFi Intrusion/threat Dataset (AWID2) was prepared by George Mason University (U.S.) and University of the Aegean (Greece) to study cyber threat detection. Specifically this project is focused on the classification using ML algorithms of impersonation attacks. Impersonation attacks can be particularly serious as they can cause unauthorized or malicious users to access the network. The datasets used for this project is a modified version of the initial AWID2 dataset where just impersonation attacks and normal traffic are considered. Both the test and the train sets are balanced (having the number of attacks being equal to the normal traffic). The number of features in the reduced CLS portion of the AWID2 dataset is 152. After a preliminary univariate analysis on these features only 78 of them have been found to have standard deviation different from zero, the very first step of features selection was to eliminate the features with variance equal to zero as they are constant so they canâ€™t contribute to explain the target variable.
